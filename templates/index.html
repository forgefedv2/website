      <h1>ForgeFlux</h1>
      <p>
        ForgeFlux is an attempt to bridge various
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forge_(software)">
          software forges</a
        >
        to provide a decentralised development environment. If successful, major
        software development workflows like pull requests/patches and bug
        trackers will be available in a decentralised context.
      </p>
      <h2>Why?</h2>
      <p>
        Free software developers are asked to choose between freedom and having
        access to a large community while choosing a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forge_(software)"
          >software forge</a
        >. Some are willing to make compromises to their freedom in order in the
        hopes of developing a community around their project while others don't.
        Either way, these are compromises.
        <a href="https://forgefed.peers.community/">ForgeFed</a> is an attempt
        to bring the best of both worlds together, but it requires the forge
        developers (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) to participate in federation
        development. Naturally, the tight integration slowed down development.
      </p>
      <p>
        We take a more organic approach towards federation &#8212; our
        federation implementation exists entirely in the API-space.
